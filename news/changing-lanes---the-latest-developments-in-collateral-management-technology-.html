 title="The latest developments in collateral management">download
here</a></p>

<p><strong>SLT: Firstly, can you tell us a little about the history
of 4sight and the range of products it provides to the
market?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: 4sight was spun off from OM Technology in 2003.
Historically it has been a provider of integrated stock loan and
repo systems across all market participant types. This includes
direct/agency lenders, niche and global broker dealers etc.
Typically, for these institutions, collateral management was a
function of the trade life cycle rather than a discipline in
itself.<br />
<br />
 Over the last two years, however, 4sight has become far more
involved in collateral management as a stand-alone discipline. This
stems from a <a href="../products/4sight-collateral-management/collateral-optimization.html"
title="Collateral Optimization">collateral optimisation</a>,
liquidity management and fee generation perspective rather than as
a mere risk mitigant.<br />
<br />
 If we look back two or three years, traders in many houses were
tasked to focus their efforts on P&amp;L generation. At the time,
there was only a secondary focus on the collateral management of
such trades. In this model, managing collateral was frequently seen
as a related but autonomous back office operation.<br />
<br />
 Many securities finance desks had access to large treasury
departments able to source term cash on their behalf on an
unsecured basis. They were also able to make use of large amounts
of unutilized govt. debt holdings with which to collateralize their
activities. Balance sheet utilization, liquidity retention and
making the optimal return on idle (high quality) inventory were not
paramount in many minds.<br />
<br />
 However, things have changed greatly over the recent past. Our
clients are increasingly seeking to optimize their collateral
processes. They want to ensure that, wherever possible, they pledge
the lowest quality non-cash collateral to their counterparts. This
allows them to retain their internal liquidity and make use of
their access to Govt debt for firm financing or fee generation
purposes.<br />
<br />
 4sight has been well placed to benefit from this market
development. Our modular collateral management system allows users
to undertake all aspects of the requisite workflow, from inventory
management, through to exposure calculation, collateral allocation,
instruction and settlement from a single system.<br />
 <strong><br />
 SLT: Is collateral management still run with a silo-based
approach? Or is it now a centralized function within many
organizations?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: Historically it was very silo based. This was as a
result of company structure and product lines and the difficulty
faced in cross product netting.</p>

<p>It frequently resulted in different departments within a given
organization having radically different eligible collateral
schedules, minimum margin thresholds and operating processes with
the same market counterparts.<br />
<br />
 However, this silo approach is being rapidly eroded.<br />
<br />
 We are currently working with a number of clients who have decided
to consolidate and centralize their collateral management. Their
business model is now focused on ensuring the optimal use of
collateral across a range of products. It includes repo, securities
lending, on exchange and OTC derivatives.<br />
<br />
 In this respect, the centralized collateral department is
effectively acting as the single interface for their organization
with their external counterparts. This is across all relevant
products and asset classes. It is also functioning as an internal
conduit of collateral to/from a range of departments within their
firm.<br />
<br />
 At 4sight, we are able to structure this activity within our
collateral management system. This ensures that the internal
sources and recipients of collateral are charged correctly.</p>

<p>Equally importantly, our software helps firms to identify
collateral and liquidity surpluses and shortfalls at a company
level. They can then act upon them well in advance.</p>

<p>This has a positive impact upon bottom line operating costs for
our users. It also ensures that all relevant collateral costs are
assigned correctly to underlying trading strategies.<br />
 <strong><br />
 SLT: What market trends or characteristics do you believe have
caused firms to look at the centralization of collateral? Do you
see these strengthening in the near future?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser:&nbsp; These are numerous and getting longer by the
day.<br />
<br />
 The Lehman default and the drying up of market liquidity were key
drivers of centralization. This increased the need to make better
use of finite resource such as capital and balance sheet.</p>

<p>In addition, the desire to better manage counterparty,
correlation and operating risk across all collateralized products
is integral to any decision to centralize such activity.<br />
<br />
 There is a significant benefit to bottom line earnings from
effective collateral management and collateral optimisation. As
firms realize the potential to reduce costs and generate ancillary
income, they are quick to embrace this decision. The result is that
institutions are now actively seeking technology solutions that can
support this model.<br />
<br />
 <strong>SLT: Does moving to an integrated approach change the way
firms look at the various risks within collateral
management?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: To some degree - yes. The primary risk focus, regardless
of operating model, remains the potential for a given counterparty
to default. The correlation of the collateral to that default also
continues to be a vital consideration. This hasn't fundamentally
changed.<br />
<br />
 However, the centralized collateral model has highlighted the
ability of a firm to look at its various risks across a range of
products and on a portfolio basis. Not just counterparty, but also
portfolio, liquidity and operating risks.<br />
<br />
 In this respect, we have increasingly worked with our clients to
model their activities and develop "What If" scenarios. Users can
run these scenarios in the collateral management system to see the
effect of a pre-determined event.<br />
<br />
 For example, this event could be a counterparty downgrading, or
increased market pricing volatility. It could be the general market
reluctance to accept a given country's securities or a given asset
class etc.<br />
<br />
 Risk managers within our client firms also want the system to send
them automated daily reports to highlight potential warning signs.
For example, they want to see whether collateral being pledged to
them is unacceptable to their own counterparty base.<br />
<br />
 They also want to see their exposure to a given country or asset
class across their combined portfolios, and/or the size of a given
collateral holding versus its free float.<br />
<br />
 <strong>SLT: Is there any difference in collateral management
within different areas? For example is collateral management
different in say, OTC derivatives compared to securities
lending?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: Historically yes. However our clients appear to be
taking the best elements from each area and seeking to make them
universal.<br />
<br />
 For example, securities finance and repo markets used to operate
with relatively low minimum margin thresholds. They also made
active use of daily margining and the delivery of non-cash
collateral.<br />
<br />
 Conversely, OTC derivative collateral management involved
significantly higher thresholds and use of a limited range of
collateral. However it allowed for a greater use of dynamic ratings
related triggers.<br />
<br />
 Now, within the centralized collateral model at least, such
variances have become noticeably less marked. We have therefore
developed support for sophisticated collateral acceptability,
concentration limit calculation, and haircut criteria. Users can
apply these criteria regardless of the underlying product they are
trading.<br />
<br />
 This in turn is allowing our clients to transform their collateral
management activity. Previously it was mainly an operational task,
now it is evolving into a liquidity and balance sheet management
function.<br />
<br />
 It is now also a way for them to lower their operating costs and
generate incremental revenue through a reduction in financing costs
or the creation of additional stock loan fees.<br />
<br />
 <strong>SLT: Does this change the human resource required for
collateral management? How does it affect the sales process 4sight
undertakes?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: To some degree - yes, but only in a positive
sense.<br />
<br />
 In the past, the primary function of a collateral manager was to
ensure the successful delivery or receipt of collateral to mitigate
that day's counterparty exposure.<br />
<br />
 This often resulted in the unnecessary use of cash and government
bonds as collateral. They were easier to move on a same day basis
in larger parcels than say corporate bonds and/or equities.<br />
<br />
 <a href="../products/4sight-collateral-management.html" target="_blank"
title="4sight Collateral Management">Collateral management
systems</a> now allow users to forecast their future collateral
needs. Furthermore, they can now also identify potential shortfalls
or surpluses in a given asset class or with a given
counterpart.<br />
<br />
 The collateral management focus has therefore been extended from
that of exposure mitigation and operational settlement to one of
ongoing inventory, liquidity and balance sheet management.<br />
<br />
 In addition, there is now a good deal of automation in mapping the
underlying legal agreements with counterparties. This allows the
collateral management system to check the amount, type and quality
of inventory that firms can pledge to a given counterparty.<br />
<br />
 It can then undertake the creation of delivery instructions on an
automated basis. However, there will be instances on a daily basis
where the collateral manager may need to over-rule its inherent
logic.<br />
<br />
 For example, he/she may be aware that a given security is
potentially to be sold or is part of a sensitive trading strategy
and is not suitable for pledging. As such, a greater internal
knowledge is required of the source and stability of assets.<br />
<br />
 The ability to immediately drill down on a given security in the
<a href="../products/4sight-collateral-management.html" target="_blank"
title="4sight Collateral Management">collateral management
solution</a> and identify its source can help to reduce errors in
this respect. The option to see whether a colleague has annotated
its potential use elsewhere can also make it easier to avoid
conflicts.<br />
<br />
 Moving onto the sales process, the integrated use of collateral
management systems for securities lending, repo, and derivatives
collateral management is certainly making the sales process longer
and more complex.<br />
<br />
 This is largely a result of the number of departments involved
(traders, collateral managers, risk personnel, operations,
regulatory reporting, finance etc.). It is also influenced by the
amount of data these users need to extract from the technology
system for their day-to-day activities.<br />
<br />
 But to some degree this is to be expected. Effective collateral
management ensures liquidity retention and lower potential
operating costs, use of balance sheet and capital. To many firms,
it is akin to the "oil within the engine". If managed correctly it
will ensure the successful continuation and expansion of their
activities.<br />
<br />
 <strong>SLT: Is there a minimum scale a business needs to have
before it can optimize its collateral?&nbsp; Can a client use
4sight for its collateral management activities but retain its
existing trading and back office systems?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: Not really. Regardless of size, leveraged trading firms
require the ability to finance their activities in the optimal
manner.<br />
<br />
 The retention of cash and high quality Govt assets - previously
used as collateral to third parties and/or exchanges - is thus of
paramount importance. This applies whether the client is an
internationally renowned global player or a small regional bank or
broker.<br />
<br />
 <a href="../products/4sight-collateral-management/collateral-optimization.html" target="_blank"
title="Collateral Optimization">Collateral optimization</a> is in
itself a relatively easy concept to understand. However, it impacts
upon all aspects of an organization's activities. This ranges from
its ability to finance its ongoing activities, through to
counterparty and market risk mitigation.<br />
<br />
 It also significantly affects the control of operating costs,
capital and balance sheet. This is equally important regardless of
the size of a client and is perhaps best demonstrated by the spread
of enquiries we have received over the past eighteen months.<br />
<br />
 It is also possible for a client to make use of a
collateral/exposure management and optimization system on a
stand-alone basis. They can merely integrate data feeds to/from
their existing trade capture and settlement instruction delivery
systems if required.<br />
<br />
 However, in many cases projects involve the development of a
tailored solution that also makes use of our <a
href="../products/4sight-securities-finance/securities-lending--borrowing.html" target="_blank"
title="Securities Lending &amp; Borrowing">securities lending and
borrowing</a>, and <a href="../products/4sight-securities-finance/repo-system.html" target="_blank"
title="Repo System">repo systems</a> to closely integrate with the
<a href="../products/4sight-collateral-management.html" target="_blank"
title="4sight Collateral Management">collateral management
system</a>.<br />
<br />
 <strong>SLT: Is this centralization and optimization of collateral
as relevant and/or prevalent in North America, which has
traditionally preferred cash?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: Previously, the US model has been to lend stock on a
callable basis against cash collateral.<br />
<br />
 However, since Lehman, most US based agent lenders now operate
both cash and non-cash collateral programs. US broker dealers are
also making use of non-cash collateral in order to minimize their
balance sheet usage and for their international activity.<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, the larger North American broker dealers have
substantial OTC client driven and/or proprietary derivative books
that they need to collateralize in an optimal manner.<br />
<br />
 As such, we are fielding more enquiries about our collateral
management system from North America than from any other part of
the world.<br />
<br />
 We have therefore broadened our scope to look at the
collateralization of ETF creation and FX forwards to complement our
clients' traditional OTC derivative activities.<br />
 <strong><br />
 SLT: How much is regulation changing the way firms manage their
collateral?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: Undoubtedly so. The effective use of collateral - in
addition to enhancing the bottom line and mitigating risk - can
also improve an organization's use of balance sheet and
capital.<br />
<br />
 For example, we are currently developing the ability within our <a
href="../products/4sight-collateral-management.html" target="_blank"
title="4sight Collateral Management">collateral management
system</a> to novate bilateral repo trades when passed to a CCP.
This will support our clients as they move their activity to the
CCP over time.<br />
<br />
 The main drivers of this the benefits of a reduced risk profile,
enhanced netting capabilities and lower capital usage.<br />
<br />
 Going forward, we anticipate working with our clients to develop a
means of calculating where trades could be most optimally written
from a balance sheet, collateral cost and capital point of
view.<br />
<br />
 This demonstrates the rapid evolution that is occurring in the
market, as our clients seek to optimize the returns on finite
resources.<br />
<br />
 <strong>SLT: How automated is the collateral management and
collateral optimization process within the 4sight
system?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: Very - the system calculates counterparty exposure on a
real time basis. This is as a result of trades being booked into
our <a href="../products/4sight-securities-finance/securities-lending--borrowing.html" target="_blank"
title="Securities Lending &amp; Borrowing">securities lending</a>
or <a href="../products/4sight-securities-finance/repo-system.html" target="_blank"
title="Repo System">repo systems</a>. Alternatively it is fed in
automatically to the collateral management system for OTC
derivative transactions.<br />
<br />
 The user can then access his inventory. As the required legal
agreements have already been mapped into the system, the user can
also allocate his collateral in line with the prevailing eligible
collateral, margining and concentration rule-sets.<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, we are currently enhancing our collateral management
solution to allow users to run "synthetic" allocations. The system
bases these allocations on eligibility and concentration criteria
and his available inventory.</p>

<p>Users can run this on an intra-day basis to identify any
potential collateral shortfalls or surpluses at contract, client,
or portfolio level.<br />
<br />
 Once the user is satisfied that they have made the optimal use of
available collateral, the software can automatically undertake the
physical allocation of securities.</p>

<p>The system also sends settlement instructions and confirmations
to each counterparty. This is across all commonly utilized asset
classes, product types and settlement routes.<br />

 <strong>SLT: How big a transition is it to make from the old way
of doing collateral management?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: Probably far less than market participants would
imagine.<br />
<br />
 Firstly, there are no changes to the underlying legal agreement.
There is merely a more detailed mapping of its core terms and an
enhanced analysis of the user's available inventory.<br />
<br />
 The number of collateral movements may increase from the days when
large parcels of Govt. debt were delivered for the sake of
simplicity.<br />
<br />
 However, the collateral management system can include all such
costs in its collateral optimisation calculations. Moreover, it
maintains all standard settlement details and routing preferences.
This means that the incidence of fails is very small.<br />
<br />
 The biggest change is probably in the user mind-set. Collateral
managers are now becoming an integral cog in the control of a
firm's liquidity, balance sheet and capital.<br />
<br />
 Whilst operational and settlement knowledge remains vital,
collateral management systems now allow users to make greater use
of technology to assist them in their collateral management
decision process.<br />
<br />
 <strong>SLT: Is this part of the business now considered a cost
saving exercise or a profit center?</strong><br />
<br />
 Palliser: It's both. Firms that have collateralized their
activities in a sub-optimal manner in the past, with cash and/or
Govt bonds borrowed from internal or external sources, should see
an immediate material saving in their daily operating costs.<br />
<br />
 The enhanced use of previously idle equity and corporate bond
inventory that <a href="../products/4sight-collateral-management.html" target="_blank"
title="4sight Collateral Management">collateral management
technology</a> systems allow will free up cash and high quality
Govt assets. It is then possible to use these assets in firm/third
party financing or fee generating securities finance trades,
providing a new revenue stream.</p>
