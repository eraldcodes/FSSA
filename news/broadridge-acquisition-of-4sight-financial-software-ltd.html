			<p><strong>LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y. - June 14, 2016 -</strong> <a
href="http://www.broadridge.com/?id=00201SPS16jnglcd39250&amp;so=pr&amp;po=fs&amp;di=&amp;ct=cd&amp;ot=pl&amp;mt=jn&amp;yr=16&amp;rg=gl&amp;on=&amp;ep=">
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a> (NYSE:BR) today announced
that it has expanded its global securities financing and collateral
management capabilities through the acquisition of 4sight Financial
Software Limited, a leading provider of securities finance and
collateral management systems to financial institutions worldwide.
4sight will be integrated as part of Broadridge Securities
Financing and Collateral Management solutions, helping clients
optimize financing decisions across different asset categories,
automate the securities financing lifecycle and control risk.</p>

<p>4sight's proven solutions and global client footprint
complements Broadridge's strong North American presence in the
securities financing market. Through this acquisition, Broadridge
now offers banks, broker-dealers, agent lenders, asset managers and
other buy-side firms best-in-class global Securities Finance and
Collateral Management solutions that include front-to-back office
securities lending, repo processing, synthetic financing and
enterprise-wide collateral management. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed.</p>

<p>Broadridge Securities Financing and Collateral Management offers
a holistic approach to support the full securities financing
lifecycle, from front-office trading automation to back-office
clearance and settlement. Its global multi-asset support delivers
an aggregated real-time view of collateral and positions across the
enterprise, enabling efficient deployment of assets and greater
control of risk, while improving operational efficiency and
reducing the cost of disparate systems.</p>

<p>"The greater demand for collateral driven by the regulatory
agenda has raised the need for a global approach to the multi-asset
securities financing lifecycle," said Michael Hopkins, president of
Fixed Income, Financing and Risk at Broadridge. "Following the
recent expansion of our North American securities lending
capabilities through the acquisition of Anetics, this transaction
marries 4sight's proven global capabilities and 13 years of
experience in securities financing with Broadridge's market-leading
securities processing solutions, broad global client relationships,
and operational expertise to deliver best-of-breed, fully
integrated Securities Financing and Collateral Management
solutions. We are delighted to welcome the talented 4sight team,
who have built an exceptional solution and have deep domain
experience in this market," Hopkins said.</p>

<p>"For decades, Broadridge has been focused on helping companies
transform their operating models to gain operational and cost
efficiency by providing proven yet innovative, market-leading
technology solutions. We are excited to join the Broadridge team
and bring our capabilities to Broadridge Securities Financing and
Collateral Management solutions," said Alastair Chisholm, founder
of 4sight and VP, general manager at Broadridge. "Through a
holistic, global and multi-asset view of collateral and positions
integrated across an enterprise, banks, broker-dealers, agent
lenders and buy-side institutions can truly manage collateral and
optimize financing decisions, while gaining a greater control of
risk and improving balance sheet management," said Chisholm.</p>

<p>Broadridge Securities Financing and Collateral Management,
including 4sight, complements Broadridge's recently-announced
Global Post Trade Management (GPTM) solution and market leading
Managed Services capabilities for business process outsourcing.
Broadridge enables front-to-back office operational transformation
across asset classes, markets and business entities globally,
delivering enhanced financial and risk management and regulatory
compliance capabilities.</p>

<p>Quayle Munro Limited acted as 4sight's financial advisor in this
transaction.</p>

"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements that are not
historical in nature, and which may be identified by the use of
words such as "expects," "assumes," "projects," "anticipates,"

favorable pricing terms; changes in laws and regulations affecting
Broadridge's clients or the services provided by Broadridge;
declines in participation and activity in the securities markets;
any material breach of Broadridge security affecting its clients'

center services provider to provide the anticipated levels of
service; a disaster or other significant slowdown or failure of
Broadridge's systems or error in the performance of Broadridge's
services; overall market and economic conditions and their impact
on the securities markets; Broadridge's failure to keep pace with
changes in technology and demands of its clients; Broadridge's
ability to attract and retain key personnel; the impact of new
acquisitions and divestitures; and competitive conditions.
Broadridge disclaims any obligation to update or revise
forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or
circumstances that arise after the date made or to reflect the
