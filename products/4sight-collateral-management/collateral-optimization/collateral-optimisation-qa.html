			<h1>Collateral Optimisation Q&A</h1>
			<p><strong>What issues in collateral optimization does 4sight's
solution address?</strong><br />
<br />
 High quality collateral is becoming more valuable due to
regulatory drives in the wake of the financial crisis such as Dodd
Frank, Basel III and Emir. These regulations stipulate that banks
must hold more high quality liquid assets to act as a buffer and
prevent bank failures in the event of another crisis.</p>

<p>They also dictate that standardized derivatives trades must be
centrally cleared. The aim of this is to reduce systemic risk, and
the central counterparties (CCPs) that these trades must be cleared
through will only accept high grade collateral.<br />
<br />
 This looks likely to create a shortfall in high quality assets,
which because of various sovereign downgrades are also dwindling in
supply. As a result, financial firms want to hold onto these assets
wherever possible - so they need to make sure they are efficient in
choosing which collateral they pledge and receive.</p>

<p>There is therefore a strong need for <a href="../../4sight-collateral-management.html"
title="4sight Collateral Management">collateral management
technology</a> systems that offer <a href="../collateral-optimization.html"
title="Collateral Optimization">collateral optimisation</a>, as the
cost savings to financial firms of optimizing their collateral are
significant.<br />
<br />
 There is also a trend towards merging collateral management across
business lines to allow greater efficiencies and consolidated views
of a firm's risk exposures. These product lines had previously been
run in separate silos with individual desks for derivatives,
securities lending and repo but in many cases are now being
combined.</p>

<p><strong>What does the collateral optimization solution enable
4sight's customers to do that they couldn't do
previously?</strong><br />
<br />
 4sight's collateral optimisation software addresses these issues
by allowing users to more accurately calculate the opportunity cost
of the collateral that they pledge and receive. This helps traders
make better decisions about whether a specific trade is going to be
profitable based on the cost of the collateral and allows more
intelligent trade pricing.<br />
<br />
 In addition, the system offers algorithms that can suggest the
best collateral to give out, based on each counterparty's
acceptability criteria. It also allows users to run 'what-if'
scenarios to allocate collateral more effectively to clients. This
helps to free up idle assets lying unused on a firms' balance sheet
that can be put to use to create an added revenue stream.<br />
<br />
 Finally and most importantly, our <a href="../../4sight-collateral-management.html"
title="4sight Collateral Management">collateral management
system</a> allows firms to manage and allocate collateral across
multiple business lines including Securities Lending, Repo and
OTC/Listed derivatives. This is probably the key differentiator
between our collateral management solution and the systems that
other vendors offer. Our background is in Securities Lending and
Repo technology, so we offer combined functionality in all of these
business lines that we believe is unique in the market.</p>

<p><strong>How will the G20 derivatives reforms impact demand for
collateral management, and how is 4sight addressing
this?</strong><br />
<br />
 As discussed above, the regulatory reforms that are coming into
force are driving a significant demand for more efficient
collateral management and optimization.<br />
<br />
 Some estimates of the global liquidity shortfall resulting from
the added regulatory capital banks will need to hold, and the extra
margin posted to CCPs run into the trillions of dollars. This means
that firms will need to be much more efficient in how they manage
their balance sheets and enhance their return on economic capital,
so collateral optimization is a key part of this.<br />
<br />
 In addition, technology systems need to offer connectivity with a
range of CCPs and support the complexities of CCP margining on a
real time intraday basis. This requires functionality to identify
which trades are applicable for CCP margining and model each CCP's
margin calculation requirements across all collateralized
products.<br />
<br />
 Systems will also eventually need to support full cross product
netting once a standard master netting agreement is formalized.
Along with interoperability between CCPs, this will significantly
decrease the amount of overall margin posted so it is a welcome
development.<br />
<br />
 Furthermore, our clients require reporting around CCP usage. This
ranges from the analysis of collateral cost per
transaction/transaction type through to proposing the optimal CCP
to use, given available collateral and surplus netting capacity the
CCP offers.<br />
<br />
 We are in close consultation with both clients and prospects on
all of these issues and are therefore in a strong position to help
our customers adapt to regulatory change and take advantage of the
opportunities that will doubtless arise from the new landscape.</p>

<p><strong>In what ways has collateral management changed in the
last few years?</strong><br />
<br />
 Collateral management has effectively moved from a way of
mitigating risk to a business opportunity. Sound collateral
management is still a powerful way of moderating counterparty
credit risk.<br />
<br />
 However, it has also evolved into a way to boost revenues and
reduce costs as pricing of collateral and credit risk becomes more
sophisticated. As time goes on it will increasingly become a way
for firms to differentiate their offerings in a highly competitive
market and is rapidly gaining more and more attention among both
buy side and sell side firms as regulatory deadlines move
closer.<br />
<br />
 From a buy side point of view there is also attention on greater
segregation of pledged assets as end users seek to ring fence
collateral in the event of a broker default (as in the recent case
of MF Global for example). Bankruptcy remote collateral will also
have a lower risk weighting under Basel III.<br />
<br />
 Likewise, restrictions around rehypothecation of collateral are
also becoming more prevalent following the demise of Lehman
Brothers. This should have the effect of reducing the velocity of
collateral and further increasing its cost.</p>

<p>From a technology perspective, <a href="../collateral-optimization.html"
title="Collateral Optimization">collateral optimisation</a> is
currently the hot topic, and we have seen huge interest in our
collateral optimisation solution. Driving this are regulatory
demands for banks to hold more capital, coupled with a need to post
margin with CCPs as derivatives trading moves to a centrally
cleared model.<br />
<br />
 This is increasing demand for high quality collateral and firms
are therefore seeking to use their collateral pools more
efficiently. It is also prompting a move to centralize the
collateral function across all business lines a firm is involved
in, which facilitates a more holistic view of assets and more
effective allocation.</p>

<p><strong>Is collateral management a profitable business, a risk
mitigation strategy, or both?</strong><br />
<br />
 Both. We should never detract from the fact that collateral
management is primarily a risk mitigation tool and as it evolves,
will continue to use ever-more sophisticated methods of assessing
counterparty credit risk and managing exposures.<br />
<br />
 However, due to shortages of high-grade collateral it is also
becoming both a cost reduction and a profit generation tool.
Successful firms are now pricing and deploying collateral more
effectively while also expanding trading opportunities through
efficient collateral use and more informed decision-making.<br />
<br />
 In this sense, collateral management is moving towards becoming a
front office trading discipline as well as an operational process.
The point should also be made that firms with superior operational
capabilities in collateral management can win market share through
better client service and more competitive pricing.</p>

<p><strong>How are firms that act across multiple product lines
integrating collateral management into their
operations?</strong><br />
<br />
 We have helped a number of clients with this process and there are
three elements to successful centralization of collateral
management: technology, operations and culture.<br />
<br />
 This equates to changes in systems, processes and importantly, the
mind set of people previously used to working in separate business
silos. Firms planning to integrate their collateral management
across securities lending, repo and OTC/exchange traded derivatives
need to address each of these factors and this can be a complex
process.<br />
<br />
 However, there are significant benefits to centralization.
Firstly, because technology systems can now consolidate views of
collateral across product lines, users can gain a clearer snapshot
of risk across the entire organization or determine net exposures
with specific counterparties. This will help firms adapt to
regulatory change and reporting more smoothly, for example around
the Dodd Frank rules on credit exposure limits.<br />
<br />
 Secondly, this centralized view of collateral can help drive
decisions on the best way to deploy assets based on their
opportunity cost and the return on economic capital a given trade
can generate. Finally, cross product netting could materialize at
some point in the future should agreements for full netting of
securities lending, repo and derivatives trades become common.</p>

<p><strong>How should the need for high quality collateral in large
quantities be balanced?</strong><br />
<br />
 While high-grade collateral will most certainly become scarcer,
the pain could be eased somewhat by CCPs accepting lower grade
assets as collateral and through the use of collateral
transformation techniques. There is some debate over whether
collateral transformation will be viable for everyone, due to the
economics of collateral upgrade trades and associated costs.</p>

<p>The regulatory standpoint on collateral transformation may also
influence the shape of the market. Some firms may also simply stop
carrying out certain derivatives transactions due to onerous
collateral requirements and instead look for alternative methods of
trading and hedging risk.</p>

<p>Furthermore, collateral optimisation, interoperability between
CCPs and more efficient netting and offsetting processes,
particularly across product types could also reduce the need for
large amounts of collateral.</p>
